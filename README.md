# assignment-5-cicd
This repository holds the starter code for assignment 5, in which we practice the fundamentals of CI/CD.

Like Assignment 4, this Gatsby app requires an (Flickr API key)[https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html] to perform the photo search, held in the FLICKR_API_KEY env variable.

It also requires an API key from (eBird.org)[https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59], held in the EBIRD_API_KEY variable.

The project is integrated with Netlify and relies on their edge function service for the Nearby bird observation functionality to work.
