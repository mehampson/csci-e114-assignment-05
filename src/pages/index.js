            <WingspanArt />
            <p>In Wingspan, players compete to build bird sanctuaries. Gameplay is centered on 450+ cards, each which a unique species of bird that has its own attributes and abilities.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s a very good game with excellent art, if you like card-based engine building games and/or birds.</p>
            <p>Wingspan data comes from <Link to="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/193164/wingspan-spreadsheet-bird-cards-bonus-cards-end-ro">here</Link>. I converted a CSV of that file to a JSON via <Link to="https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm">this conversion app</Link>, and then did some additional manual cleanup to get the structure how I&rsquo;d like it.</p>
            <p>Each bird has its own page with gameplay information and a gallery of the ten most &rdquo;interesting&rdquo; photos of that bird on Flickr. The photos come from Flickr&rsquo;s public API, and are searched by tags. (There are too many birds and photos for me to review the accuracy of the search results, so caveat emptor.)</p>
